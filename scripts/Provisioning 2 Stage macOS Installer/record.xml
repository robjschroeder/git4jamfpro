  <notes>Created by Jamf Provisioner. This script will run in the "Provisioning 2" policy. After the "Provisioning 1" policy successfully downloads the latest version of the "Install macOS" app, this script will be immediately run to move the app to /private/var/macOSInstaller, save the version number in a text file for the extension attribute to read, and then package it up into a DMG. If any previous versions exist, this script will delete those first.</notes>
